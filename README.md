# TreehouseNodeProject
This is the project I created in the Treehouse node tutorial.

The app takes input from the console in order to print out how many badges and points in a particular language a user has.  
It takes input for a single or multiple users through the command line by typing username followed by language after the command to run the program, "app.js".  If you are inputing multiple users, you must follow each by the language.
